# A hash of account module types
#
# Although these can be defined anywhere in your Hiera structure,
# the most manageable approach is to define all your accounts here,
# and realize them in your profiles via tags.
#
# This module should only be used for general accounts. Do not
# list accounts here that might be controled directly using a module
# E.g. apache user should be managed via the apache module, not here.
#
# See http://forge.puppetlabs.com/torrancew/account
# for supported properties.
